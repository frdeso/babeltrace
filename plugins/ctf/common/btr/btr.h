 * Event-driven CTF binary type reader (BTR).
 *
 * This is a common, internal API used by CTF source plugins. It allows
 * a binary CTF IR field type to be decoded from user-provided buffers.
 * As the type is decoded (and, possibly, its nested types), registered
 * user callback functions are called.
 *
 * This API is only concerned with reading one CTF type at a time from
 * one or more buffer of bytes. It does not know CTF dynamic scopes,
 * events, or streams. Sequence lengths and selected variant types are
 * requested to the user when needed.
